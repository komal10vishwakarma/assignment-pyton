2. Factorial of a Number
In project scheduling, tasks are dependent on previous tasks, and the total number of ways to arrange them is calculated using factorial. Factorial of a number n is the product of all numbers from 1 to n.
Write a program to calculate the *factorial of a given number using loops*.

Input: n = 5
Output: Total Ways = 120


'''

n= int(input("Enter number that you went calculate  "))
fac =1
for i in range(1,n+1):
      fac = fac*i;

print(f"Factorial of {n} is {fac} ")

print("BY the while loop")
fac =1
while n:
     fac *=n
     n-=1

print(f"Factorial of is {fac} ")
