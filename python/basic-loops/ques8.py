8. Count Multiples of 5 Between Two Numbers
A supermarket gives coupons to customers whose token numbers are multiples of 5. The manager enters a token range and wants to know how many eligible token numbers exist.
Write a program to count numbers divisible by 5 between two given numbers using loops.

Input:
1 20

Output:
Count = 4

'''

num1 = int(input("Enter the number 1 :- "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the number 2 :- "))
count=0
while num1<=num2:
      if num1%5==0:
         count+=1
      num1+=1

print(f"Enter the numbers divisible by 5 is {count} ")
