# 5. Count Vowels and Consonants
# A language-learning application wants to analyze the characters used in a paragraph.

# Write a Python program that reads a file named "paragraph.txt" and counts:

# 1. Total number of vowels
# 2. Total number of consonants

# Ignore numbers, spaces and special characters.

# Input File: paragraph.txt

# Python Programming is Interesting.

# Expected Output:

# Total Vowels: <display count>
# Total Consonants: <display count>


with open("question5/pargraph.txt","r") as f:
    data=f.read()
vcount=0
ccount=0
for i in data:
     if i.lower() in "aeiou":
          vcount+=1
     elif i.upper() in "QWRTYPSDFGHJKLZXCVBNM":
          ccount+=1

print(f"""
Total Vowels: {vcount}
Total Consonants: {ccount}
